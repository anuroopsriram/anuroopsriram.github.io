- title: Open DAC 2023 (ODAC23)
  description: "
    Direct Air Capture (DAC) involves directly capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and has been widely recognized as a crucial tool in combating 
    climate change. Despite its potential, the broad implementation of DAC has been impeded by high capture costs. Key to overcoming this hurdle is 
    the discovery of novel sorbents â€” materials that pull carbon dioxide from the air. Discovering new sorbents holds the key to reducing capture costs 
    and scaling DAC to meaningfully impact global carbon emissions.

    The DAC space is growing rapidly with many companies entering the space. To engage the broader research community as well as the budding DAC industry, 
    we have released the OpenDAC 2023 (ODAC23) dataset to train ML models. ODAC23 contains nearly 40M DFT calculations from 170K DFT relaxations involving 
    Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with carbon dioxide and water adsorbates. We have also released SOTA GNN models trained on this dataset.

  description: "
    Scalable and cost-effective solutions to renewable energy storage are essential to addressing the world's rising energy needs while reducing climate change. 
    As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from 
    times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the potential of scaling 
    to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen. To be widely adopted, this process requires cost-effective 
    solutions to running chemical reactions.<br><br>
    An open challenge is finding low-cost catalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density functional 
    theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures 
    that may be tested. The use of AI or machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new approaches in finding 
    effective catalysts.<br><br>
    To enable the broader research community to participate in this important project, we have released the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) and 2022 (OC22) datasets for 
    training ML models, along with baseline models and code. These datasets altogether contain 1.3 million molecular relaxations with results from over 260 million 
    DFT calculations.

- title: "fastMRI Dataset (Knee & Brain MRIs)"
  description: "
    Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by taking fewer measurements has the potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make MRI 
    possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or expensive. By producing accurate images from under-sampled data, AI can be used to speed 
    up MR image acquisition by upto 10x or more.<br/><br/>
    To enable the broader research community to participate in this important project, we released datasets containing roughly 1,500 fully sampled knee MRIs, and 
    7,000 fully sampled brain MRIs, in addition to DICOM images from 10,000 clinical knee MRIs.

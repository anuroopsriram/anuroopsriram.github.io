# Welcome!

I am an AI researcher at Meta FAIR, working on applying deep learning to scientific problems.

My current focus is on using AI to discover new catalysts for use in renewable energy storage as part of the <a href="https://opencatalystproject.org/" target="_blank">Open Catalyst Project</a>. 
As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand.
A possible solution that can scale to nation-sized grids is to use excess energy to create other fuels. To be widely adopted, we need to discover new electrocatalysts to synthesize these fuels in a cost effective manner. While quantum mechanical simulations can be used to test new catalyst structures, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of materials that can be tested. Machine Learning provides a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new approaches in finding effective catalysts.

Previously, I had worked on accelerating MRI scans using deep learning as part of the <a href="https://fastmri.org/" target="_blank">fasMRI project</a>.
Prior to joining Meta, I worked as a Senior Research Scientist at <a href="http://research.baidu.com/" target="_blank">Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab</a> with Andrew Ng on speech recognition, and as an AI Engineer at Twitter.

I have a Masters in Language Technologies from the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Language Technologies Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roni/" target="_blank">Prof. Roni Rosenfeld</a> on modeling the spread of infectious diseases using machine learning and agent based modeling.

# Welcome!

I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher at Meta FAIR working on applying AI to scientific problems.

Over the last few years, I've been focused on using AI to accelerate material discovery for combating climate change. I am leading the <a href="https://open-dac.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenDAC project</a>, focused on discovering new sorbents for Direct Air Capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide from ambient air. Our goal is to lower the cost of carbon dioxide capture, a critical step for achieving <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" target="_blank">global net zero goals</a>. I am also deeply involved in the  <a href="https://opencatalystproject.org/" target="_blank">Open Catalyst Project (OCP)</a>, that is involved in discovering new electrocatalysts for renewable energy storage. This work addresses the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like wind and solar by exploring scalable solutions for storing excess energy as fuels.

Previously, I worked on large scale self-supervised and multilingual speech recognition as the manager for the FAIR Speech team, scaling speech recognition systems to unprecedented scales in terms of model size, dataset size and number of languages.

Prior to that, I worked on applying AI to medical imaging. As lead of the <a href="https://fastmri.org/" target="_blank">fasMRI project</a>, I developed models that accelerated MRI scans by over 4 times. This has the potential to reduce imaging costs, minimize stress to patients and make MRIs more accessible.

From 2016 to 2018, I was a Senior Research Scientist at <a href="http://research.baidu.com/" target="_blank">Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab</a> with Andrew Ng on speech recognition, where I helped develop the <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/amodei16.pdf" target="_blank">Deep Speech 2 model</a>, that was chosen as one of the top 10 technology breakthroughs of the year by MIT Tech Review. Prior to Baidu, I built online ML pipelines for ad ranking and targeting at Twitter.

I have a Masters in Language Technologies from the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Language Technologies Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~roni/" target="_blank">Prof. Roni Rosenfeld</a> on modeling the spread of infectious diseases using machine learning and agent based modeling as part of the <a href="https://fred.publichealth.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">FRED project</a>.

<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p class="text-justify">
I am an AI researcher at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/" target="_blank">Meta FAIR</a>, working on developing novel deep neural network architectures and large-scale training methods. Over the past decade, I have developed deep learning architectures and distributed training methods that have been adopted across industry and academia.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
Currently, I work on AI for scientific discovery, developing generative models, scaling methods, and datasets for atomic systems. My research includes distributed training algorithms for large-scale systems and novel neural architectures. Previously, I led the FAIR Speech team, building new multilingual and self-supervised speech models that achieved significant production adoption at Meta.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I have also worked on accelerating medical imaging through deep learning models now used in clinical practice, contributed to early neural speech recognition systems (like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595" target="_blank">Deep Speech 2</a>), and pioneered multimodal fusion methods.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I hold a Master's in Language Technologies from <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I applied machine learning to study epidemic dynamics.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
My research has been featured in prominent publications such as the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, USA Today, Reuters, Fortune, TechCrunch, and MIT Tech Review.
